##Code Fellows Python 401 Learning Journal Project

This project covers the setup and deployment of a learning journal using Pyramid, a python web framework.  The visual look of the page will be sleek and clean (which it's not really yet, but I'll keep working on it in my spare time).  The back-end guts of the project will be updated in an iterative manner over the coming days and eventually new learning journal entries will be entered here, live on a deployed Heroku dyno.


##Heroku Deployment

This project will be deployed to Heroku periodicially throughout it's devleopment, you can take a look at it here:

## Learning Journal Day 2

For day two's assignment I completely refactored my views with decorators and swapped out the old html for fancy jinja2 templates.  Thanks/credit to Mike for helping me set up the detail view with the regular expressions.

## Learning Journal Day 3

For day three's assignment I was completely lost for a while.
Got some help from Mike and Victor, a bunch of us came in on Sunday to work.
