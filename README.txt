learning_journal README
==================

This is a Repo for our Code Fellows 401 Learning Journal assignment.  The purpose of the assignments here is to work through a deployment of a basic templated site to Heroku using the Pyramid web framework.

# Day 1

Today we initally installed Pyramid into our repo and set up basic templates.

# Day 2

On day two we refined our views using Decorators and improved our templating.  We introduced basic testing.

# Day 3

On day three we reinstalled Pyramid using the SQLAlchemy package and refactored all our data sources to pull from a local sqlite db.

# Day 4

On day 4 we switched to a PostgreSQL db and deployed to Heroku, rewiring as necessary to hook up to PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.

# Day 5

On Day 5 we implemented a log in prompt and secured some of our views so that only authorized users can add and edit posts.
